Quality improvements are welcomeâ€”if you see a typo or want to add more test cases, go ahead and open a pull request!

If you want to add a feature, please open an issue to discuss the proposed feature first, and don't be surprised if it gets rejected. Remember that *the whole point is minimalism*; any new feature is inherently contrary to that goal. To have a new feature accepted, you'll have to demonstrate that the benefits of the feature overwhelm the cost of its complexity.
